Simple double day counter for whatever reason. I use this on my old Android phone that is on my nightstand.

* Requires Android 4.4 (API level 19)

##### Development log
- [x] Usage of Epoch timestamps to make the counting somewhat reliable
- [ ] Easier date setup (currently setting an epoch time to the source code is supported only)
- [ ] The ability to change the background image (without touching the source code)
